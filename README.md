# About

We are a group of 4 University of Waterloo Math and CS students. This project was made for the uOttaHack 5 hackathon. ReviewRecap targets the challenges issued by the following companies: Noibu, Cohere, GitHub, and Microsoft Cloud.

The backend of the server projects uses Python's Django framework to serve a RESTful API. The frontend is a Chrome extension made with JavaScript.

# Installation/Usage

**Note: to install and use ReviewRecap, you must set up BOTH the Chrome extension and the backend server!**
